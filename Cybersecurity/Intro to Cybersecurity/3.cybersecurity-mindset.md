There are three basic mantras for the cybersecurity mindset:

1. **Trust, but verify.** - This means to always double check everything we do.
2. **Stop. Think. Connect.** - Stop and take a moment when thinks are not going well. Stop and think before you clic or connect.
3. **If you see something, say something.** - While surfing the web, if you see something broken, not working or a security breach, report it.
