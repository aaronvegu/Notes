## Cybersecurity Foundations Summary

In the Maintaining a Secure Critical Infrastructure lesson, we evaluated specific security techniques used to administer a system that meets industry standards and core controls. We covered the following areas:

Governance and Compliance
Security Regulations
NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls
By now, you should be able to

Explain cybersecurity governance concepts
Apply method to enforce cybersecurity governance
Identify common security regulations and frameworks
Explain how current security laws, regulations and standards applied to cybersecurity and data privacy
Recognize components of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Recognize components of the CIS Controls
