## Vulnerability Management

According to NIST, a vulnerability is:
_“Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat.”_

In IT systems, vulnerabilities are inevitable, but not all are bad, sometimes an vulnerability can be minor or difficult to exploit.

**Vulnerability Management** starts with **Identifying** the vulnerability, **Analying** it, and then, **Taking action**.

#### Identification

We need to know what are this vulnerabilities and where to find it.

In IT and software, there are some sites with plenty information and databases with common and new known vulnerabilities listed:

[NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)

[MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list](https://cve.mitre.org/about/index.html)

You can take part in Bug bounty programs to detect and receive prices for finding vulnerabilities, and there is always the option of find it with **Security assesments** that are configured for your OS and environment configuration.

#### Analysis and Action

The next step, once you have know the vulnerabilities, is to **Analyze** the situation and decide whats number of action you would take to prevent or solve the problem.

For example, in software you can have 3 options:

1. Patch and install new updates
2. Buy new and better software to replace it
3. Do nothing

Every option will be affected by your pocket and specific scenario.

You also need to considered the **Zero Day (0 Day)** vulnerabilities, Zero-Day (0-Day) Vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that have no notification to the manufacturer or public.

#### Summary

**Identification** is finding vulnerabilities.

**Analysis** is studying the vulnerability and deciding a course of action.
The CVE and NVD websites provide vulnerability ratings. The manufacture may also tell you their idea of the risk.

**Taking Action** is doing something about the vulnerability once you’ve analyzed its risks and the benefits of applying a fix.

CVE is “a list of common identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.” It was started over 20 years ago to create a common language and naming convention for all vulnerabilities. In the early days, manufactures would have their own names and identification numbers, which became very confusing.

The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. They perform analysis on CVEs that have been published to the CVE Dictionary.
