## Vulnerability Management

According to NIST, a vulnerability is:
_“Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat.”_

In IT systems, vulnerabilities are inevitable, but not all are bad, sometimes an vulnerability can be minor or difficult to exploit.

**Vulnerability Management** starts with **Identifying** the vulnerability, **Analying** it, and then, **Taking action**.
