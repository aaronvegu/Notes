## Hacking Lifecycle

Hackers don't attack systems randomly, they use a specific life cycle or process to meet their goals.

#### Steps

1. **Goal**. Define the goal, system or device to attack.
2. **Learn it**. Learn as much as you can about the target -_Hackers don't work from ignorance_.
3. **Explore it**. Explore from all perspectives, understand how it works and recognize its parts.
4. **Break it**. Here you understand the targets, weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
5. **Fix it**. If you break something in the previous stage, fix it. Secure systems, devices, applications and networks from threats.
6. **Make it better**. Find the way to better secure the assets.
7. **Tell others**. Don't keep secrets, tell others what you find. _This is called Ethical Disclosure_.
