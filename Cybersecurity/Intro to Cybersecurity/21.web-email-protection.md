## Email Protection

Web browsing and email are the most potential places where your organization can be affected, thats why is important to implement a series of basic defenses to protect them.

Basic email security implementations:

1. Inventory of accounts - personal and business accounts
2. Known if the emails accounts has been breached in haveibeenpwned.com
3. Use a standard format for the accounts

There are also several **email authentication protocols** to prove to external email servers that all your emails come from you and it´s not an impostor:

1. **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** tells external receiving email servers that your organization’s email servers are approved to send emails from your business’s domain name.
2. **Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)** adds a digital signature to your outgoing email so that external email servers can confirm that your email is from your domain.
3. **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)** verifies the address the server uses matches the “from” address. It also tells external email servers what to with potentially suspicious emails from your domain.
