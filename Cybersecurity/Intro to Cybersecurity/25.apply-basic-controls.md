## Recommend and Apply Basic Security Controls

Once you identify potential security issues like vulnerabilities and threats, you need to recommend how to minimize the risks. These are putting protective or detective measures in place to meet security requirements and keep others from breaking it either on purpose or by accident. This can be done with technical settings, corporate policies, user training, or all three. You can use the CIS Controlsâ„¢ for guidance on how you should secure computer systems.

#### Secure the Configuration of Software, Operating Systems & Networks includes the following steps:
