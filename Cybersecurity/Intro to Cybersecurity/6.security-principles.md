## Security Principles

This principles are not specific to IT or Cybersecurity but explain and are used to structure how we protect our technologies

Those are taken from the [Saltzer and Schroeder Design Principles](http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/index.html) published in 1975.

1. **Economy of mechanism**
   Keep things small and simple, complexity is an enemy of security because you always need to know all the possible ways to corrupt the system.
2. **Fail-safe defaults**
   Ensure a safe state by defaul for when things fails -> Fail smart
   Example of the door:

- Walk-in freezer: power goes out (fail) door open by default (safe)

3. **Complete mediation**
   Every access to every object must be checked for authority
4. **Open design**
   System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components
5. **Separation of privilege**
   Functions should be separate and provide as much granularity as possible
6. **Least privilege**
   Only have the access you need to do the job
7. **Least common mechanism**
   Its best to have a single process or service gain some function without granting than same function to other parts of the system
8. **User-friendly interface**
   Keep an clean and easy interface that interacts to the user
9. **Choke points and Defense in depth**
   Choke point -> only one way in or out
   Defense in depth -> layers of security

### The Security CIA

1. **Confidentiality** - Keep the secret secret, limiting who can see and read sensitive information.
2. **Integrity** - Limit who can change or modify the information
3. **Availability** - Ensure information and devices are there when need it
