## Hardening Systems

In addition to layering protection, another step to put on defenses is the concept of "Hardening Systems", which means applying optimal security settings to protect our systems or entities against attacks or human errors.

We can follow established guides to know how to hard our systems, like the **CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchkmarks**, that provide us with guides for common networking devices, OS and Applications.

These guides are free and distributed as PDF files on the website: cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks

Examples of benchmarks:

- Desktops & Web Browsers
- Mobile Devices
- Network Devices
- Servers – Operating Systems
- Servers – Other
- Virtualization Platforms & Cloud

As a security and systems administrator, we use these guides to tell us how to harden our systems.
