One example of applied layering protection is when a **user or employee access a database for client information**:

| Layering       | Protection                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Data           | Encrypted Data                        |
| Database / App | Permissions, Firewall, Access Control |
| Op System      | Credentials                           |
